# This tells AMS to use the :json_api serialization adapter, to include a top-level object, 
# and to adhere to v1.0 of the JSON:API specification. For some reason, AMS's default :json_api 
# configuration does not include a top-level object, despite the JSON:API specification's insistence on a 
# top-level object called "data".
